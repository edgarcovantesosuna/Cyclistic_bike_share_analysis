The **hypothesis** is that the director believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.\n\nTo do this, it is necessary to understand how the different customers behave, for this we need to study how *casual riders* (customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and *annual members* (customers who purchase annual memberships) use Cyclistic bikes differently.\n\nThe **goal** for the team is to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. And to achieve such goal the team has defined the following research questions that will guide the analysis:\n\n1.  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\n2.  Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n\n3.  How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\nIn this case, we will focus on the first question, provide insights about the different habits of casual riders and annual members using Cyclistic bikes.\n\n## Obtaining the data set\n\nWe have used Cyclistic's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. For this we have make use of the information contained in the following ZIP files ([available here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)):\n\n| ZIP file names          | Date Modified              | Size     |\n|:------------------------|:---------------------------|:---------|\n| Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.zip | Nov 8th 2021, 04:05:26 pm  | 9.57 MB  |\n| Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.zip | Nov 8th 2021, 04:06:12 pm  | 28.72 MB |\n| Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3.zip | Jan 24th 2020, 10:08:06 am | 42.36 MB |\n| Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4.zip | Jan 24th 2020, 10:08:07 am | 18.40 MB |\n| Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.zip | May 26th 2020, 07:17:43 pm | 15.92 MB |\n\nThe reason we have chosen those files is to have the newest information for the analysis, the complete 2019 information, plus the 2020 Q1.\n\n## Loading libraries\n\nNext we define a few libraries what we will need through the whole project.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# To plot figures\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Common imports\nimport os\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-10T22:12:54.917687Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-10T22:12:54.918306Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-10T22:12:54.934313Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-10T22:12:54.918276Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-10T22:12:54.933376Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading data-sets\n\nBefore we start working on the downloaded data-sets, let us first detailed how we have defined our work-space:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Root name of the dataset location.\nDATASET_DIR = '/kaggle/input/divvy-trips-2019-q1-q4-2020-q1'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-10T22:15:49.668069Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-10T22:15:49.669139Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-10T22:15:49.673904Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-10T22:15:49.6691Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-10T22:15:49.672769Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The folder called `DATASET_DIR` can be found containing the CSV files to be analyzed.\n\nNow, we can load the CSV files corresponding to 2019 Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and 2020 Q1.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"q1_2019 = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(DATASET_DIR, 'Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv'))\nq2_2019 = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(DATASET_DIR, 'Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.csv'))\nq3_2019 = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(DATASET_DIR, 'Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3.csv'))\nq4_2019 = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(DATASET_DIR, 'Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4.csv'))\nq1_2020 = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(DATASET_DIR, 'Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-10T22:15:52.845385Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-10T22:15:52.845744Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-10T22:16:11.145707Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-10T22:15:52.845718Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-10T22:16:11.144483Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When observing the output provided by R from running the previous code chunk we can see that the data-frame `q1_2020` has 13 columns while the others have 12.
